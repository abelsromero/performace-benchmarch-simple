== Preparing Go environment

. Install Go, in Arch based distros just run
 
 $ pacman -S go dep

. Setup `GOPATH` environment variable (https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/new-project.html[see]).
Place the shell at `go/src` path and run

 $ export GOPATH="$HOME/go:$(dirname $(pwd))"

INFO: `echo $GOPATH/` should end in `go` directory.

== Building

Place at the directory `go/src/go-numbers-runner`.
Run `go build`

== Running

`go-numbers-runner` binary will be created at the source of `go-numbers-runner` directory.

NOTE: Use `go clean` to delete the binary in a safe way.
